# rl-graphicgemos
Collection of small graphical programs I made using raylib.
# Building
Right now only Linux is supported.
You need to add header and library files into this directory from latest release of raylib and run make. Dynamic linking is prefered because building produces few small executables all depending on a same library.
# Special thanks
- Raysan for developing raylib, graphical library I used for this project. Libray is a zlib licensed software. Read more at raylib-license.txt
- GitHub user Sieep-coding. His GitHub repo snow-simulation inspired this project.
- User baz from Stack Overflow. I used his implementation of random float number generation.
